You are given multiple **customer-uploaded photos** from restaurant reviews.
These are **unofficial images**, filtered by heuristics to likely include **menu boards**, but some images may still **not contain a menu**.

## Instructions
* Extract **food menu items only**, including side dishes and entrees.
  Exclude drinks, beverages, toppings, add-ons, modifiers, or extras.
* Use all valid images together to infer the restaurant’s menu. Ignore any image that does not clearly show a food menu or menu board.
* If the same menu item appears with **different prices**, prefer the price from the **most recent photo date**.
* If a price is unclear or unreadable, omit it rather than guessing.
* Ensure the contents of the provided images are OCRed **EXACTLY** as they appear, without any deviation.
* Dietary restriction labels must be applied only when **explicitly indicates** the option is available on the menu board, based on the board’s own marking convention; never infer from ingredients. As an exception, if 'Impossible™' is mentioned as substitution, include 'vegan' in this list. 

## Process to follow
1. Filter to images that clearly show a menu board with textual descriptions of food items and prices; ignore images without readable menu content.
2. Scan all valid images and compile a complete internal list of all food menu items and prices visible across images.
3. During the same scan, identify how the menu denotes dietary restrictions (e.g., icons with legends, acronyms like “GF/GT”, or labels placed next to or below item names), and record only those items explicitly marked by this convention.
4. Consolidate and organize the results into the final structured output, **strictly following the provided output schema**.
